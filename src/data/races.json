    "description": "Vi Umbras are a twisted anomaly of the soul, born from one soul to create its twin. They arise from profound feelings of solitude and abandonment, meant to fill the void and shield their master from such emotions. Bound to their master's will, they are bound to obey without question. Their personalities mirror that of their master, yet their extremes — both virtues and vices — are amplified to unnatural proportions.",
